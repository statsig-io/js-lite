## Statsig Lite JavaScript Client SDK

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Support for this version of the SDK ended January 31, 2025.
> All users of the `js-lite` npm package should migrate to the `@statsig/js-client` package for bug fixes, performance improvements, and new features.

A slimmed version of the [JavaScript](https://github.com/statsig-io/js-client) SDK for single user client environments. If you need an SDK for another language or server environment, check out our [other SDKs](https://docs.statsig.com/#sdks).

Statsig helps you move faster with feature gates (feature flags), and/or dynamic configs. It also allows you to run A/B/n tests to validate your new features and understand their impact on your KPIs.
